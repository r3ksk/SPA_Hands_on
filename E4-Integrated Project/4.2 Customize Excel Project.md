In this tutorial, we will customize the excel project to the needs of a common project.

J1. As a first step let us add **Get Folder Collection** to the **baseFolderPath** environment variable. This step will return all the sub folder names within a given fodler name. in our case, it will give each timestamp based folders fetched from each email from the outlook. Rename the output parameter to **folderList** | ![Get Folder Collection!](Images/GetFolderCollection.png)
J2. You can see the result by using a **Log Message** | ![Log result of get folder collection!](Images/LogGetFolderCollectionsResult.png)
J3. We will loop through each folder. for this will add **For Each** loop to the flow | ![Add First For Each on Folder Collection Result!](Images/AddForEach.png)
J4. We will add all the required steps into the folder. the idea is on each file, a certain set of actions needs to be performed | ![Move Excel actions inside the loop!](Images/MoveExcelActionsInsideForEachLoop.png)
J5. Within each index of **For Each**,  we can fetch list of excel files in each folder. for this, we will add **Get File Collection** to the loop | ![Add Get Filde witin a golder!](Images/AddGetFIleCollection.png)
J6. the value for **Get File Collection** is as given in the image | ![Log output of Get File List Collection!](Images/GetFileListValue.png)
J7. We will add one more **For Each** to loop through each excel file in that sub folder. Here to distinguish both the loop variables, you can rename it appropriately. Also include the required excel actions within this sub **For Each** loop. | ![Add a 2cond For Each!](Images/AddSecondForEach.png)
J8. first create a string variable to generate from the loop variable full path to the excel file | ![!](Images/AddFilePathVariable.png)
J9. Adjust the **Get File Name** to take the output variable | ![get the file name based on these changes!](Images/GetFileName.png)
J10. We have hardcoded ranges in **Filter Range**. when we generalize the functionality, we may wanted to calculate this at run time. For this, we will be adding **Get UsedRange Row** and **Get UsedRange Column** activities to find out the start and end cell values. |![Amend Filter Range with Dynamic Calculations!](Images/AddStarRangeStarActivities.png)
J11. We will now use a custom script activity to calculate complete range. | ![Add a custom script to calcualte range of excel!](Images/AddCustomScript.png)

````
var startColumn = 1;

var startCell = String.fromCharCode(startColumn + 64) + startColumn;

var endCell = String.fromCharCode(columnRange + 64) + rowRange;


return startCell + ":" + endCell;
````

J12. just for demonstration purpose, we will filter against first column and look for cell values containing a | ![Apply Filter Range on First column!](Images/FilterRangeDynamically.png)
J13. We will use similar approach to find out range of values after filtering to be used with **Copy Range** | ![Similarly use dynamic calculations on Copy Range!](Images/DynamicRangeCalculation.png)
J14. We will apprend "\_new" to the new csv file name in **Save As Workbook** | ![Use the loop varaible for Save as Workbook!](Images/SaveAsWorkbookPath.png)
J15. Like Outlook sample, you need to release the package and publish to the library. You can do so either from the SAP Process Automation Lobby or from within the project. |
